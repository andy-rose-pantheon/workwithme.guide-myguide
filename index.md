## Values

Above all, I value loyalty. I will always have you back and be there for you and appreciate when people recipricate. 

## Personality

* *Friendly*: I promise, I want to be friends with you. Though I wont always start a conversation. 
* *Empathetic*: I feel you dawg. 
* *Energetic*: You will never catch me on a nap-cation. I am ALWAYS go-go-go. 

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

Never resist to give me feedback! When it is negative or constructive, please bring it to me directly. I will accept your input with open arms. 

## Work Patterns

I'm a bit of a night owl, so I typically work between *10am and 7pm*. This works out with my time zone being an hour ahead of the HQ office for Pantheon. I like to do a *short workout* in the afternoon to re-energize. 

I'm always down for pair-programming or just sitting down with someone and working on something. I will likely never turn down a request unless I have a very tight timeline to get something done. 

## Communication Preferences

*SLACK* PLEASE! I don't have a great conversational memory. I frequently go back and follow up on Slack messages. I check email once or twice a day, so it is my snail mail at work. 

Contact me at *any time*. If I am available, I will answer right away. 

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

Oh geez. This doesn't happen hardly at all, at or outside of work. I would say if I am in a bad mood, my speech will be very short and direct. I may even bring it up with you directly.

### How to help

Talk to me. Let me get some stuff off my chest. Discuss it with me. *Help me* get through it.
Don't be afraid to disagree with me when I am upset, I am still listening and receptive. 

## Me Being Me

* Dad Jokes: I am...not a commedian, but I like to joke about many things. Just deal with it :) 
* Dry Conversation: I love talking to people, but I am literally THE WORST at coming up with topics for discussion. Seriously, gun to my head if someone said "say something interesting or die", I wouldn't be able to come up with anything. Please don't take that as me not wanting to talk to you.
* Fidgey McFidgetson: Sometimes, I have a very hard time sitting still. If I move around a lot during a meeting and change positions, it is not because I am not interested. I just can't help it. 

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

* Like 95% of all my pet peeves are around driving. Good thing I don't carpool with you.
* People that say they are going to do something and don't even try to follow through.
* When people hold a grudge, but act like nothing is wrong until one day they bring all the things up at once.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

I could see myself being in a leadership position at some point. For now though, I just like to kick ass and get shit done!

## Areas for Development

* Asking questions too soon. Sometimes I will be working through something and feel it is taking too long and ask for help before truly exhausting my other resources.
* Sometimes I take things WAY too literally.
* I could use some improvement on context switching. I tend to get carried away by one thing at a time.

## Ask Me About

* Music! I DJ/Produce and love to swap musical knowledge with people. 
* Snowboarding/Skiing!
* The things you find at Ross Dress For Less
* RPG Games
